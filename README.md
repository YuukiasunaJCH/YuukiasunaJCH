# 👋 WELCOME!

Hey there! I'm **C. Jiang**.

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Master’s degree** in *Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering* at **Tianjin University**, where I also completed my undergraduate studies here.

My research lies at the intersection of **engineering**, **machine learning**, and **graph neural networks**, with a focus on smart structural design and simulation.
